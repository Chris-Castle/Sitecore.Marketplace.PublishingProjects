# Sitecore.Marketplace.PublishingProjects

This module allows you to create publishing projects which let you manage the release date of a group of item versions.  This is accomplished by setting the publishing restrictions on the individual items when they are added to a project.

It includes additions to both content and experience editor to add projects, add versions to projects, view what versions are in a project, gutters, notifications, etc.
